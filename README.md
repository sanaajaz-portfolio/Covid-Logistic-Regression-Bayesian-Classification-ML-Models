# Covid Logistic-Regression-Bayesian-Classification ML Models
     The objective of this Covid Analysis is to build a logistic regression model so we can predict if one is infected with the Covid-19 illness based on the symptoms they are reporting. With Logistic regression it's COVID 19 positive or negative, is binary and shows which symptoms are most important for identifying positive cases. The second goal of this analysis is to use a Naïve Bayes classifier to estimate the likelihood that a person has COVID-19 based on their symptoms. Essentially, the model aims to answer the question: “Given this set of symptoms, how probable is it that the individual is COVID-19 positive?” The project involves exploring the dataset, preparing the symptom variables, building and training the Naïve Bayes model, and assessing its overall performance.
