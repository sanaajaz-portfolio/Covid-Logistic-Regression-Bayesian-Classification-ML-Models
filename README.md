# Covid-Logistic-Regression-Bayesian-Classification-ML-Models
     The objective of this Covid Analysis is to build a logistic regression model so we can predict if one is infected with the Covid-19 illness based on the symptoms they are reporting. With Logistic regression it's COVID 19 positive or negative, is binary and shows which symptoms are most important for identifying positive cases.
